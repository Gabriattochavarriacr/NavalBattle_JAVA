# NavalBattle_JAVA
I have created this game in Java as a university project of the Fundamentals of Programming course, at CENFOTEC University, called: "Battleship" or Naval Battle, simplified. This game consists of the user being able to play against the computer and whoever manages to shoot down all the ships of the opposing team or whoever has the best score wins.
